        <b>Production</b> <br><br> It was based on a short film called Within the Woods, that served as a “proof of concept” that got Sam Raimi $90,000 (later $375,000) to produce the film. It was filmed in a secluded cabin in Tennessee and was an extremely difficult process for the cast and crew, who had to suffer through frostbite, injuries, and irritation. </p>

        <b>Influence</b> <br><br> Its graphic violence may have gotten it into trouble with the censors, but this was always a problem of splatter movies back then. Its ingenious, low-budget special effects and terrifying scares still hold up today and are part of what makes it one of the best-known cult films today. The Evil Dead was released with lukewarm reception until a rave review from famous horror author Stephen King led it to the Cannes Film Festival and to it popularizing the splatter genre beyond an underground horror subgenre.</p>
